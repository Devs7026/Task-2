# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview
This project covers Task 2 of my internship: performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the cleaned Titanic dataset to uncover patterns and relationships useful for machine learning.

## Steps Performed

1. **Loaded Cleaned Data**
   - Imported the cleaned Titanic dataset from Task 1.

2. **Generated Summary Statistics**
   - Used pandas to calculate mean, median, standard deviation, and other descriptive stats for all numerical features.

3. **Visualized Numeric Features**
   - Created histograms and boxplots for features like Age, Fare, SibSp, and Parch to understand their distributions and spot any outliers.

4. **Explored Feature Relationships**
   - Used a correlation matrix heatmap to identify relationships between variables.
   - Created pairplots to visually explore how features interact, especially with respect to survival.

5. **Identified Patterns and Trends**
   - Found that sex, class, and fare are strong predictors of survival.
   - Noted that most passengers were young adults, traveled alone or with small families, and that higher fares were linked to higher survival rates.

6. **Documented Key Insights**
   - Summarized main findings and visual patterns to inform future modeling steps.

## What I Learned
- How to use visualizations and summary statistics to quickly understand a dataset.
- How to spot key predictors and potential issues (like outliers or skewness) before modeling.
- The importance of EDA in building effective machine learning solutions.
